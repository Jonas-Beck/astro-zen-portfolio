      Hi, I'm Jonas Beck, a passionate Junior Developer with a focus on enhancing developer experience and building internal tooling. With experience in platform engineering and Kubernetes,\n

      During my journey, I've contributed to improving development workflows through internal developer portals like Backstage, creating custom plugins, and building tools that streamline how teams deploy and manage their services. I am also a maintainer for the official Kyverno CNCF project, following my contribution of the policy-reporter Backstage plugin that enables teams to view policy reports directly in Backstage, which I continue to maintain and improve.
